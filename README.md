# Exploratoty Data Analysis On A Movies Dataset
## Introduction
Below i will give an overview of the steps i followed in my analysis.

### 1. Business Understanding.
In this phase i focused on understanding the oobjectives and
requirements of the project. Based off the project summary that was provided, it is evident that our client is seeking to venture into the Film Industry and would like us to provide him with insights on what types of movies are doing the best at the box office and also how different factors would affect their investment.
Based on this, the objectives of this analysis were:
   1. Find the relationship between the budget and revenue.
   2. Find the movies that grossed the most revenue
   3. Perform analysis on the Return On Investment(ROI)
   4. Find which movie genres had the highest ratings
   5. Find which movie genres has the highest ROI

### Data Understanding.
In this phase, i identified and collected the data that will be need in the analysis process and also familiarized myself with the data by identifying the different fields contained in the tables i'll use in my analysis.

### Data Preparation.
Here, i did the selection of the data i will use from different table then did the data cleaning by checking to see if there are missing values in the data, the presence of outliers, invalid data, duplicates or mispelled text in the data.

### Data exploration.
Here, i did the data exploration by checking to see if there are any patterns and relations in the data. Derive new attributes like the revenue that would help answer some of my analysis questions, integrate the data by joining diffrent data frames also format the data where necessary.

### Data Visualization.
In this phase, i came up with different visualization models to help me summarize and communicate my finding in a way that is understandable. Some of the models are used are bar plots and scatter plots.

### Data Deployment.
This was the final phase in my analysis. I got to communicate my findings and also provide insights and recommendations.
